Designed and constructed an 8x8x8 RGB LED (512 LEDs soldered together) cube using C programming language in tandem with MPLAB to animate 3D patterns while offering a dynamic range of exploding colors & speeds.
Assembled with nine Microchip PIC18F4321 microcontrollers (1 master, 8 slaves) & three decoders allows for full control of an individual LED. The flow of the design patterns incorporates an XYZ coordinate system while the communication protocols between microcontrollers are handled by a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). With only one LED on at a time, patterns trick the human eye into thinking multiple LEDs are on at once.
